# ARYAN - Automated Reviewer of Youthful Accounts and Nuisances

**ARYAN** is a Discord bot designed to manage your server by enforcing account age restrictions and providing logging for mods.

Tired of banning accounts, only having them return immediately with a fresh alt? ARYAN acts as your serverâ€™s bouncer, checking accounts are older than your server's set minimum account age.

## Features

- **Account Age checking**: Automatically time out new members if their account is younger than the configured minimum age.
- **Customizable Timeout Messages**: Configure personalized messages for users who are timed out.
- **Logging**: Send logs of bot actions to a designated channel.
- **Slash Commands**: Easily use ARYAN with discords / commands.

## Commands

### `/setminage`

Set the minimum account age (in hours) for new members to join your server.

- **Usage**: `/setminage hours: 24`
- **Description**: Sets the minimum account age to 24 hours.

### `/setusermessage`

Set the message sent to users who are timed out.

- **Usage**: `/setusermessage message: Hi {user}, your account is too new to join this server. You have been timed out for {hours} hours.`
- **Description**: Personalise the timeout message. Use placeholders `{user}` and `{hours}` to dynamically include the user's name and amount of time they are timed out for.

### `/setlogschannel`

Set the channel for logging actions.

- **Usage**: `/setlogschannel channel: #staff-logs`
